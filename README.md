# Cache Algorithms for Learning

This repository contains TypeScript implementations of the Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache algorithms. The purpose of this repo is to provide a learning resource for understanding these cache replacement strategies.

## Overview

- **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: Removes the least recently used item from the cache.
- **Least Frequently Used (LFU)**: Removes the least frequently used item from the cache.
